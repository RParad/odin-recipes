    <h3>Steps</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400F degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. Add chicken wings to a large mixing bowl. Add in cornstarch olive oil, salt & pepper and seasonings. Mix together until chicken wings are evenly coated. Add a large wire rack on top of each baking sheet and spray wire rack with cooking spray. Evenly add chicken wings on the wire racks, making sure there is enough room between each chicken wing. Add 1 tbsp of honey overtop of the chicken wings and bake for 40 minutes. Pulling them out halfway and flipping.</li>
            <li>Once chicken wings have been flipped, Add 1 tbsp of honey over top of the wings and add back to the oven for 20 minutes.
